# Event Driven Achitecture

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
  
Run the following command to run the sample application

This sample application is based on this repo:

Gabril Sadaka wrote good article about this implementation architecture:

If you wanna use WSL2 to run Docker on Windows I would recommend to follow these instructions:
